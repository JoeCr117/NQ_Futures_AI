# This a Deep Learning Project for Predicting Nasdaq Futures price action.

## By Joseph Crouson

In this project, the objective is to create an A.I. model that will be capable of taking
the last X minutes of price data and predicting Y minutes into the future.

This is a student project and should not be used in the real world, this is simply to learn and
demonstrate skills I have aquired during the project to potential employers.
